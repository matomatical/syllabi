Syllabi
=======

Sometimes I find it fun to sketch out a high-level course syllabus on a
topics of interest.
This may be based on a course I have taken but was not quite satisfied with,
or just a course I would want to take or have taken or teach if it existed.
You may find the a useful source of interesting topics for self-directed
study.
