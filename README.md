Syllabi
=======

Sometimes I find it fun to sketch out a high-level course syllabus on a
topic of interest.
This may be based on a course I have taken but was not quite satisfied with,
or just a course I would want to take or teach if it existed.
You may find these useful sources of interesting topics for self-directed
study.


Courses
-------

* [Artificial Intelligence](ai.md)---a high-level tour of many topics in the
  quest to create intelligent machinery. Original. Way too long for a
  semester.

* [Ethics of Artificial Intelligence](eai.md)---topics and readings from
  COMP90087 at the University of Melbourne, with my own list of topics at
  the end (just an initial sketch).

* [Machine Learning](ml-jams.md)---sequence of introductory topics in ML,
  loosely based on the overrated coursera course. Incomplete.

* [Thermodynamics](thermal.pdf)---a long time ago, I sketched a class on
  statistical mechanics.


TODO:

* See reMarkable notes about rearranging Statistical Learning Theory class.
* Make a class on computation.
* Complete and elaborate on these syllabi into full courses.
