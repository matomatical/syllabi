Syllabi

Sometimes I find it fun to sketch out a high-level course syllabus on a
topic of interest.
This may be based on a course I have taken but was not quite satisfied with,
or just a course I would want to take or teach if it existed.
You may find these useful sources of interesting topics for self-directed
study.


Courses
-------

* [Artificial Intelligence](ai.md)---a high-level tour of many topics in the
  quest to create intelligent machinery


TODO:

* Make a class on computation
* Add notes from ML-JAMS (course, resources, excercises, on introductory ML)
* Type up thermodynamics class? (and then study it, haha)
* Rearrange Ethics of AI class?
* Rearrange Statistical Learning Theory class?
