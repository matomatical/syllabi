Artificial Intelligence
=======================

What I might put into a semester class on the foundations of artificial
intelligence. Very high-level.


Prerequisites
-------------

Recommended:

* Programming
* Algorithms
* Probability
* Linear algebra
* Theory of computation

Actually, I'm not sure about these. There woudn't be time to teach a complete
beginner these things from scratch, but also I would want to focus on pretty
basic/foundational ideas within some of these topics.

Maybe each week could have recommended resources for anyone lacking the required
background.

Syllabus
--------

 1. **Philosophy and history:**
    Intelligent systems;
    Minds, machines, (and more(?));

    Overview of syllabus;
    Recommended resources.

 2. **Logic and deductive inference:**
    Reason;
    Syllogisms;
    Formal logic;
    Mechanised reasoning;
    Limits of logic.

 3. **Probability and inductive inference:**
    Chance and belief;
    Uncertainty;
    Axioms and optimality (Dutch book);
    Bayes rule.
    (Frequentist v. Bayesian? Maximum entropy?)

 4. **Causal inference:**
    Probabilistic graphical models;
    (I don't actually know about what to put here).
    
 5. **Information and knowledge:**
    Information theory;
    Communication;
    Compression;
    Signal v. noise;
    Occam's razor and the minimum description length principle;
    Entropy.
    (Connections to thermodynamics and to the free energy principle?)
    
 6. **Pattern mining:**
    Clustering;
    Unsupervised learning;
    Cost functions;
    Prediction;
    The (automatic) scientific method.
    
 7. **Function approximation:**
    Supervised learning;
    Classification;
    Regression;
    Deep learning;
    Gradient-based optimisation;
    Model selection;
    Generalisation.
    
 8. **Planning and search:**
    (various classical algorithms for search and planning).
    
 9. **Reinforcement learning:**
    Bandits;
    Exploration and exploitation in the face of uncertainty;
    Sequential decision-making and the reward hypothesis;
    Off- and on-policy, model-based and model-free reinforcement
    learning algorithms;
    Deep reinforcement learning.
    (Examples: robotics, atari, motor control. Free energy principle?)
    
10. **Competition and cooperation:**
    Multiple agents (or merely part of environment?);
    Adversarial search;
    A little game theory;
    (look further into multi-agent AI stuff...!).

11. **Computation and intelligence:**
    Computation;
    Program synthesis;
    Kolmogorov complexity;
    The universal prior;
    Algorithmic probability and Solomonoff induction;
    AIXI;
    Approximations.

12. **Philosophy of mind:**
    Consciousness, information processing, and intelligence;
    Qualia, intentionality, and the Chinese Room;
    Complex systems and emergence;
    AI suffering and AI rights?;
    (what else?).

13. **The future of intelligence:**
    Artificial general intelligence;
    Paths and challenges;
    Artificial superintelligence?
    Control problem;
    Beneficial AI.

Other topics (haven't yet found a place):
  Language;
  Abstraction;
  Limits of human intelligence and rationality;
  Evolution and intelligence.


TODO:

* Read work from Turing, Wiener, Minsky, Bostrom, Friston, etc.
* Re-read GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach?
* Read "Out of Control"
* Read Holland, 1992, "Adaption in Natural and Artificial Systems"
* Read Nitzberg, "Solomon's Code" or something
* MIRI has a good high-level syllabus for logic
